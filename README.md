# Portfolio
This is my portfolio, Holger Rosén.

I have been programming on my own since I was 16, eg 5 years but since
last year i have been studying Computer Science at Stockholms Universitet (but many of our courses are at KTH).

The programs in this repo were written by me and my fellow Fredrik Bergström.
I got top marks in scheme and python last term and top marks in java this term.

For an uncomplete game written by me see my hotloadedgame repo.

I am a fast learner when it comes to programming languages and frameworks.
